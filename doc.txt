GETTING STARTED:

These scripts will debug Policy Installation.
There is one for the Management and the other is for the Gateway.
They will also gather basic information from the machine (disk space,
free memory, running processes, hotfixes, etc.) and other files relevant.

When the script is finished running, all the files will be compressed
The script will then print the location of the tgz. 



SUPPORTED VERSIONS:

Management script is supported on:
R65 and up
Gaia and SecurePlatform
SmartCenter and MDS/Provider-1 which includes Domain/CMA

Gateway script is supported on:
R65 and up for regular Gateways
R75.40VS and up for VSX
61k/41k

1100 and other SG80 series Gateways are not supported.



INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN:

1. Upload debug script tar file to a temporary directory.

2. Extract the script.
  [Expert@HostName]# tar xvf SCRIPT_NAME.tar

3. Run the script.
  [Expert@HostName]# ./SCRIPT_NAME

Note - Do NOT install policy from SmartConsole while the debug is running. 

4. Answer the questions if asked.
5. The script will stop automatically when it is finished.
6. Upload the tgz file using Check Point Uploader on sk108152.



HELP MENU:

Both scripts have a help menu that shows the optional flags available.

# ./SCRIPT_NAME -h



FLAGS FOR BOTH SCRIPTS:

# ./SCRIPT_NAME -d

If the script itself is failing or not working, it can be debugged. 
Debug output will be on the screen and in a log file named, 'script_debug.txt'.
The log file will be created same directory as the script.

# ./SCRIPT_NAME -f

This will enable more debugging flags.
To see what the additional flags are, refer to each scripts' flags section.

# ./SCRIPT_NAME -s

The minimum disk space check will be disabled and all debug files will be
written to /var/log/tmp/policy-debug.
This option is not recommended to be enabled, but is available in case it is needed.

# ./SCRIPT_NAME -v

Display the version information of the script.



MANAGEMENT SCRIPT FLAGS:

# ./SCRIPT_NAME -f

This will enable "export TDERROR_ALL_ALL=5" on all debugs except slow policy installation.

# ./SCRIPT_NAME -m

Debug installing policy to more than one Gateway or Cluster.
The script will ask for the names of the Gateways or Clusters.
Enter their names separated with a space. Example: Gateway1 ClusterA



GATEWAY SCRIPT FLAGS:

# ./SCRIPT_NAME -b

Manually define the kernel debug buffer.
The script will use 32000 for the buffer by default.
If the Gateway fails to allocate a 32MB buffer, it can be manually defined. 

# ./SCRIPT_NAME -f

This will enable more kernel debugging flags.
The script will only run 'fw ctl debug -m fw + filter ioctl' by default.
If this option is enabled, the below commands are run:

fw ctl debug -m fw + filter ioctl cmi 
fw ctl debug -m WS + error warning 
fw ctl debug -m cmi_loader + error warning policy info 
fw ctl debug -m kiss + error warning htab ghtab mtctx salloc pm thinnfa

These additional flags will use more CPU and memory to run.
This may cause some loaded Gateways to stop responding or crash.
Run this flag only in a maintenance window.



RELEVANT FILES:

session.log - script log showing any options chosen and debug syntax used.
general.txt - basic information from the machine.
