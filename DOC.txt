GETTING STARTED:

This script will debug Policy Installation.
It will also gather basic information from the machine (disk space,
free memory, running processes, hotfixes, etc.) and other files relevant.

When the script is finished running, all the files will be compressed
and will then print the location of the tgz. 



SUPPORTED VERSIONS:

Management servers:
R65 and up
Gaia and SecurePlatform
SmartCenter and MDS/Provider-1 which includes Domain/CMA

Gateways:
R65 and up for regular Gateways
R75.40VS and up for VSX
61k/41k
1100, 1400 and other SG80's



INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN:

1. Upload policy_debug.tar file to a temporary directory.

2. Extract the script.
  [Expert@HostName]# tar xvf policy_debug.tar

3. Run the script.
  [Expert@HostName]# ./policy_debug.sh

Note - Do NOT install policy from SmartConsole while the debug is running. 

4. Answer the questions if asked.
5. The script will stop automatically when it is finished.
6. Upload the tgz file using Check Point Uploader on sk108152.



HELP MENU:

Both scripts have a help menu that shows the optional flags available.

# ./SCRIPT_NAME -h



FLAGS FOR BOTH SCRIPTS:

# ./SCRIPT_NAME -d

If the script itself is failing or not working, it can be debugged. 
Debug output will be on the screen and in a log file named, 'script_debug.txt'.
The log file will be created same directory as the script.

# ./SCRIPT_NAME -f

This will enable more debugging flags.
To see what the additional flags are, refer to each scripts' flags section.

# ./SCRIPT_NAME -v

Display the version information of the script.



MANAGEMENT SCRIPT FLAGS:

# ./SCRIPT_NAME -f

This will enable "export TDERROR_ALL_ALL=5" on all debugs except slow policy installation.

# ./SCRIPT_NAME -m

Debug installing policy to more than one Gateway or Cluster.
The script will ask for the names of the Gateways or Clusters.
Enter their names separated with a space. Example: Gateway1 ClusterA

# ./SCRIPT_NAME -s

The minimum disk space check will be disabled and all debug files will be
written to /var/log/tmp/policy-debug.
This option is not recommended to be enabled, but is available in case it is needed.



GATEWAY SCRIPT FLAGS:

# ./SCRIPT_NAME -b

Manually define the kernel debug buffer.
The script will use 32000 for the buffer by default.
If the Gateway fails to allocate a 32MB buffer, it can be manually defined. 

# ./SCRIPT_NAME -f

This will enable more kernel debugging flags.
The script will only run the below commands by default:

fw ctl debug -m fw + filter ioctl
fw ctl debug -m kiss + salloc thinnfa

If this option is enabled, the below commands are run instead:

fw ctl debug -m fw + filter ioctl cmi 
fw ctl debug -m WS + error warning 
fw ctl debug -m cmi_loader + error warning policy info 
fw ctl debug -m kiss + error warning htab ghtab mtctx salloc pm thinnfa

These additional flags will use more CPU and memory to run.
This may cause some loaded Gateways to stop responding or crash.
Run this flag only in a maintenance window.

# ./SCRIPT_NAME -s

The minimum disk space check will be disabled and all debug files will be
written to /var/log/tmp/policy-debug or /logs/policy-debug if SG80.
This option is not recommended to be enabled, but is available in case it is needed.



RELEVANT FILES:

session.log - script log showing any options chosen and debug syntax used.
general.txt - basic information from the machine.
